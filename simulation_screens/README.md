## Simulation example
In this folder are present some screens taken from a previous simulation and corresponding to the main steps of the simulation.<br>

- initialisation process (*initialisation.png*):
  is implemented through: 
  - the construction and initialisation of the datasets
  - the parsing of the original *POIs* for each category block.
  - the parsing and storing process of the municipalities.

- baseline construction (*baseline.png*):
  *N* users are simulated to construct the baseline on which the recommendation system is based.

- *users.png*: 
you can see the differences in the recommendation system architecture between *Past users* processing and *New users* processing.

- *recommendation.png*:
  the baseline is periodically updated to improve the accuracy od the  recommendation system.
